# Project Tabletop RED: Character Sheet Manager (v0.4.1)
Around fall of 2023, I decided to look into the Godot game engine. Around that same time, I was playing a lot of the tabletop role-playing game, Cyberpunk RED, created by R. Talsorian Games. This culminated in starting this personal project of mine, a character creator and character sheet manager for Cyberpunk RED built in Godot.

## Godot
This project was built using Godot v4.1.1, with the code being written in Godot's own GDScript. Some sections of the code rely on hard-coded references to objects in scenes, and may break if used without proper the references set.

I have here a document for keeping track of my thoughts and patch notes. It was originally meant to be for my eyes only, so there may be a few segments that come off as more casual than professional. In the future, I plan to upload the project as downloadable application on Itch.io.
